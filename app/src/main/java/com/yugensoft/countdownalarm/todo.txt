Notes on startup versus AlarmClockExtreme:
- First page is a 'by clicking continue you agree' page, with terms links etc
- Second page is a 'thankyou for installing' + recommendation to buy remove ads
- App pages have a tiny 'remove ad' button above each ad
- There is a prominent "Upgrade" button in the action bar on the main page
- Price is $3.89

Testing:
make some 'espresso tests'

Test-list:
